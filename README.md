# EduLink: Conecting Students with HODs

EduLink is a scheduling platform designed to simplify the process of booking academic appointments. Developed during my degree at UniAbuja, the project facilitates appointment management between students and the Head of Department (HOD). Students can book appointments with available times set by the HOD, and receive email notifications for booking confirmations, approvals, or cancellations.

## 🌟 Features

- **Appointment Scheduling:** HODs set available days, and students can book appointments, with bookings allowed up to one day before the date.
- **Email Notifications:** Automated emails notify students when their appointment is booked, approved, or canceled.
- **Admin Panel:** HODs can manage scheduling availability and appointment statuses.
- **Authentication:** Secure registration and login via email/password or OAuth.
